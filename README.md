# GeneroCity Smart Parking App
**GeneroCity** is a smart parking application developed in collaboration with the Gamification Lab at the University of Rome “La Sapienza.” Designed to improve parking efficiency in urban areas, the app leverages user interaction and real-time data sharing to help drivers find and exchange parking spots. Available for both Android and iOS, *GeneroCity* integrates sensors and a user-friendly interface, simplifying the parking process while reducing traffic congestion and environmental impact. The project also includes a sensor system that collects and processes data to enhance user experience, with future plans for advanced machine learning capabilities.
